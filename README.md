Gym Rats is a workout app made with Flutter and was a part of my capstone project. The idea behind this was to create an all-in-one workout app that can be used to create and share custom workouts with the ability for trainers(spotters) to modify client workouts remotely.



## Features

- Create & share custom workouts
